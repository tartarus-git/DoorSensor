Found this weird thing. I don't know if it's a bug in Raspbian or if I'm just dumb, but moving Folder/. into New_Folder doesn't work for some reason.
I get that it's a sort of redundant expression, but it still should work right?
It comes up with a an error saying device or resource is busy. Really weird. If this is a bug, consider reporting it.
